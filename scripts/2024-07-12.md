**Chrome‚Äôs Built-in AI Doesn't Require The Internet**

ü§Ø¬†Someone discovered Chrome‚Äôs new embedded Gemini Nano LLM works without an internet connection. Cool!

Not surprising when you think about it, since it‚Äôs embedded in the browser. But thinking about this brings up fun ideas for how you might use it; I‚Äôm a fan of getting things done on subways, so this would be an alternative to Ollama for that.
